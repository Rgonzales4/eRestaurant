Hey girlies,

Here's a prototype for the home page - I tried to use this vid (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkQc-8uzxIA) to do this on the original
    page @ "/views/home.ejs" but nothing I do is working. Here's the general vibe of what I was going for - please excuse the placeholder
    for the nav bar

go nuts and lmk what you think xx
